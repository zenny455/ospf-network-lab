# ðŸ–§ OSPF Network Lab


---

## 1) OSPF implemented
**OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** is a **link-state routing protocol**. Routers exchange **Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)** to describe their interfaces and neighbors. Each router builds the same **link-state database (LSDB)** and runs **Dijkstraâ€™s SPF algorithm** to calculate the shortest paths.  

- **Areas:** The network is split into **Area 0 (backbone)** and **Areas 1, 2, 3**.  
- **Backbone:** Area 0 is mandatory in multi-area OSPF; all other areas must connect to it.  
- **ABR (Area Border Router):** Routers between Area 0 and other areas. They maintain LSDBs for multiple areas and summarize LSAs.  
- **Result:** With OSPF, all PCs across all areas can connect through shortest, loop-free paths.

## 2) IPs are assigned automatically by DHCP
A central DHCP service assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS servers automatically (here DNS is not provided). This avoids manual configuration errors and speeds up network deployment.

---

## 3) VLANs help bind DHCP to the right interfaces
The network uses **VLANs** to separate devices into logical subnets. Each VLAN:  
- Maps to one **IP subnet**  
- Has a dedicated **DHCP pool**  
- Gets routed by its **default gateway** on the router/L3 switch  

This ensures clients receive the correct addressing information for their VLAN.

---

## 4) IEEE 802.1Q encapsulation
Links between switches and routers are configured as **802.1Q trunks**. This tagging ensures:  
- VLAN frames keep their identity end-to-end  
- DHCP requests from each VLAN are forwarded correctly  
- Inter-VLAN routing works without confusion  

---

## 5) Purpose of this project
- âœ… Show how OSPF backbone & ABRs provide scalable multi-area routing  
- âœ… Demonstrate automatic IP allocation with DHCP per VLAN  
- âœ… Use IEEE 802.1Q encapsulation to carry VLAN traffic across trunks  
- âœ… Prove that **all PCs in the lab can connect with each other** through correct routing
